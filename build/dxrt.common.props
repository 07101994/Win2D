    This file contains build system properties that are common between C# and
    C++ projects.

  <PropertyGroup>
    
    <!--

        <__OutputPath> is used to initialize <OutputPath> for C# and <OutDir> for C++.

        Every project gets its own directory to put its artifacts in.  This is
        particularly important for Store apps since these will have files with
        the same name (eg AppXManifest.xml) that are different for each project.
