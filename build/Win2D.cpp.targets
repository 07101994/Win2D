       Microsoft.Cpp.AppContainerApplication.props unconditionally overwrites it.
       So instead, we make sure each C++ project has individually set the right thing. -->

         TODO: remove this once DevDiv.1029064 is fixed
    
         Work around DevDiv.1029064.  Microsoft.NetNative.targets contains a
         target that will always touch the winmd file generated by a project -
         even if everything else in the project was up to date and didn't
         rebuild.  This breaks incremental builds.

         We override the target here to be a no-op to work around this.
