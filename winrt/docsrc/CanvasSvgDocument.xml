      <summary>Specifies an SVG document that can be drawn.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          To draw SVG, first create a document using 
          <see cref="M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Svg.CanvasSvgDocument.Load(Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasResourceCreator,System.String)">Load</see> 
          or 
          <see cref="M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Svg.CanvasSvgDocument.LoadAsync(Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasResourceCreator,Windows.Storage.Streams.IRandomAccessStream)">LoadAsync</see>.
          Then, draw it to a drawing session using
          <see cref="O:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession.DrawSvg">DrawSvg</see>. For example, in C#,
          <code title="C#">
            <![CDATA[
            using namespace Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Svg;     

            CanvasSvgDocument svgDocument;

            void canvasControl_CreateResources(CanvasControl sender, Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.CanvasCreateResourcesEventArgs args)
            {
                svgDocument = CanvasSvgDocument.Load(sender, "<svg><circle fill=\"#660000\" r=\"500\"/></svg>");
            }

            void canvasControl_Draw(CanvasControl sender, CanvasDrawEventArgs args)
            {
                args.DrawingSession.DrawSvg(svgDocument, sender.Size);
            }            
            ]]>
          </code>
          It's recommended that apps load their SVG resources only once, rather than every time they are drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to being drawn directly, SVG can also be used as an image- for example, to used as source for an image brush, 
          or an input to an effect. To do this, use a command list. For example, in C#:
          <code title="C#">
            <![CDATA[
            void canvasControl_Draw(CanvasControl sender, CanvasDrawEventArgs args)
            {
                CanvasCommandList commandList = new CanvasCommandList(sender);

                using (var ds = commandList.CreateDrawingSession())
                {
                    ds.DrawSvg(svgDocument, sender.Size);
                }

                OpacityEffect opacityEffect = new OpacityEffect();
                opacityEffect.Opacity = 0.5f;
                opacityEffect.Source = commandList;

                args.DrawingSession.DrawImage(opacityEffect);
            }
            ]]>

          If your application may run on operating systems prior to Windows 10 Creators Edition, it should call
          <see cref="M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Svg.CanvasSvgDocument.IsSupported(Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDevice)">CanvasSvgDocument.IsSupported</see>
          to query whether SVG is supported before using it.

          Currently, Win2D supports a subset of SVG 1.1. For more details, see
