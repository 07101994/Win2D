      <summary>Gets or sets an array describing a custom dash pattern.
               This overrides the <see cref="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasStrokeStyle.DashStyle"/>
               property, which is only used when CustomDashStyle is set to null.</summary>

      <remarks>
        <p>A custom dash style is an array whose elements specify the length of each dash and space in the pattern.
           The first element sets the length of a dash, the second element sets the length of a space,
           the third element sets the length of a dash, and so on. The length of each dash and space in
           the dash pattern is the product of the element value in the array and the stroke width.</p>
        <p>This array must contain an even number of elements.</p>
