      <summary>A swap chain is a series of buffers that can be drawn to and presented to the screen.</summary>
      <remarks>Like a bitmap, a swap chain has a fixed with and height, and stores 2D 
      information. Underlying this, however, it may consist of multiple 
      buffers. For more information about native swap chains, see the 
      documentation on

      <summary>Initializes a new instance of the CanvasSwapChain class, with the specified width and height.</summary>
      <remarks>The swap chain's pixel format will default to 
      DirectXPixelFormat::B8G8R8A8UIntNormalized, its buffer count will be 2, 
      and its alpha mode will be CanvasAlphaBehavior::Premultiplied. </remarks>
