      <summary>A swap chain is a series of buffers that can be drawn to and presented to the screen.</summary>
      <remarks>Like a bitmap, a swap chain has a fixed with and height, and stores 2D 
      information. Underlying this, however, it may consist of multiple 
      buffers. For more information about native swap chains, see the 
      documentation on 
      <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb174569(v=vs.85).aspx">IDXGISwapChain</a>.</remarks>

      <summary>Initializes a new instance of the CanvasSwapChain class, with the specified width and height.</summary>
      <remarks>
        The swap chain's pixel format will default to DirectXPixelFormat::B8G8R8A8UIntNormalized,
        its buffer count will be 2, and its alpha mode will be CanvasAlphaBehavior::Premultiplied.
        Size is in device independent pixels (dips), and DPI is taken from the specified resource creator interface.

        DPI describes the ratio between device independent pixels (dips) and actual physical pixels.
        The identity DPI value is 96, which means dips and pixels are the same.
