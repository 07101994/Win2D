    <member name="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Effects.IGraphicsEffect">
      <summary>Abstract interface representing an effect used for image processing.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          When targeting the Universal Windows Platform,
          this interface is moved to the namespace Windows.Graphics.Effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          C++ developers can QI an IGraphicsEffect for the IGraphicsEffectD2D1Interop interface,
          which exposes all the information needed to construct a matching D2D effect.
        </p>

    <member name="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Effects.IGraphicsEffect.Name">
      <summary>Attaches a user-defined name string to the effect.</summary>
      <remarks>
        The name string is not used directly by Win2D.
        Applications can use this to store arbitrary information of their choosing,
        for instance it could be used as an id to locate a particular effect in a graph.

    <member name="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Effects.IGraphicsEffectSource">
      <summary>Represents a type that can be accepted as input for an IGraphicsEffect.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          When targeting the Universal Windows Platform,
          this interface is moved to the namespace Windows.Graphics.Effects.
        </p>
        <p>Although IGraphicsEffect objects will accept any IGraphicsEffectSource as their source,
           <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession"/> can draw only objects
           which implement <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasImage"/> such as
           <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasBitmap"/>,
           <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasCommandList"/>,
           or an image processing effect.</p>
