      <remarks>
        CanvasRenderTarget is useful for offscreen rendering.

      <example>
              <p>Like <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasBitmap"/>, CanvasRenderTargets are created against an ICanvasResourceCreator, such as a device or control.</p>
              <code>
                CanvasRenderTarget renderTarget = new CanvasRenderTarget(canvasControl, new Size(100, 150));
                
                using(CanvasDrawingSession drawingSession = renderTarget.CreateDrawingSession())
                {
                    drawingSession.Clear(Colors.Blue);
                }
