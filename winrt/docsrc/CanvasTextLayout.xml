          var format = new CanvasTextFormat();

              ds.DrawTextLayout(textLayout, 100, 200, Colors.White); // White text is drawn at (100, 200)

      <remarks>
        <p>
        Pair kerning is a scheme where a table permutes every glyph against
        every other glyph, and each pair has an explicit kerning value defined. This option
        is desired for some legacy rendering. Non-pair-kerning is determined using
        a more sophisticated computation involving classes of glyphs, and this is the default.

        <p>
        Pair kerning isn't supported on all typefaces. If pair kerning is specified, but the
        typeface doesn't support it, non-pair-kerning will be used.
