      <remarks>
        <p>
          This method chooses fonts from the system font set.
        </p>
        <p>
          While a CanvasTextFormat contains a font family name and some other properties, 
          it's not an explicit reference to a font, nor does it guarantee that a piece of 
          text can be drawn with that exact font family. 
          An application needs to apply font fallbacks to match a piece of text to an actual font
          that will support it. When drawing a CanvasTextLayout constructed with a particular 
          CanvasTextFormat, for example, Win2D performs that matching automatically. Here, 
          an application can perform the same matching.
        </p>
        <p>
          If glyphs in the text aren't supported by the text format's font family or aren't
          compatible with its other properties, this method will try to return another
          similar font which is compatible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method only uses the locale, font family, font weight, stretch, and 
          style from the passed-in text format. It doesn't use its other properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can happen that there are some glyphs that don't match any available font.
          When that's the case, there won't be a CanvasCharacterRangeFont which
          spans that character. For glyphs not supported by any font, an app may choose 
          to display nothing, or draw another glyph instead.
