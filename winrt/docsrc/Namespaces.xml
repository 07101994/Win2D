      <summary>
        <p>This namespace provides image manipulation effects such as blur and saturation.</p>
        <p>Effects are a type of <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.ICanvasImage"/>, so they can be displayed 
           using <see cref="O:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession.DrawImage"/> or 
           <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasImageBrush"/>. The source data fed into an effect 
           is also of type ICanvasImage, which allows you to connect either a bitmap or another effect. 
           Complex image processing graphs can be constructed by chaining many effects together.</p>
