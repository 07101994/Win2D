      <summary>Pixels outside the edge are marked as black which makes edge color softer after processing.</summary>
	  <remarks>
	    <p>The effect pads the input image with transparent black pixels for samples outside 
	       of the input bounds when it applies the convolution kernel. This creates a soft edge 
	  	 for the image, and in the process expands the output bitmap by the size of the kernel.</p>

      <summary>Pixels outside the bounds are mirrored.</summary>
	  <remarks>
	    <p>The effect extends the input image with a mirror-type border transform for samples outside 
		   of the input bounds. The size of the output bitmap is equal to the size of the input bitmap.</p>
