      <summary>Derives from Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Imaging.SurfaceImageSource and extends it to know about Canvas types.
               Most apps should use CanvasControl instead of directly managing their own CanvasImageSource.</summary>

      <example><code>
        var imageSource = new CanvasImageSource(canvasDevice, width, height, dpi);
                                                
        imageControl.Source = imageSource;

          Size is in device independent pixels (dips), using the specified DPI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alphaMode parameter determines whether the background of the image
          source is opaque or not.  An opaque image source is slightly more
          efficient than a transparent image source.  CanvasAlphaMode.Ignore
          indicates an opaque background, while CanvasAlphaMode.Premultiplied
          indicates a transparent background.  Passing CanvasAlphaMode.Straight
          to this parameter will result in an error.

        Changing this property binds the image source to a different device.
        This is used after a new device is recovered after a device lost.

      <remarks>
        DPI describes the ratio between device independent pixels (dips) and actual physical pixels.
        The identity DPI value is 96, which means dips and pixels are the same.
